# Tabletop Dice Roller

This is Tabletop Dice Roller! This is a mobile app that can be used to roll dice of all different types, amounts, and combinations! From a d2 coin, all the way up to a d100 percentage dice, and everything in between. This app shuffles several times through all numbers available for your chosen dice to simulate a real dice roll to make it as fair and accurate as possible. If you find yourself rolling the same combo of dice often, you can even save dice profiles for easy later use. Just select your dice, then hit **_Roll!_** to let the dice decide your fate!

I created this app to have a fun, interesting, and convenient way to roll dice. It's especially made for when you do not have dice with you, for players new to tabletop / board games, and everyone else who wants a fun new way to roll dice!

## Future Work

- I need to work on the other pages: Add Dice and Add Modifiers

- Along with the other pages, I need to build their backend code that actually updates the dice list & modifiers variable.

- I need to add a feature where the user can save "profiles" of commonly rolled dice (2d20 for advantage/disadvantage, 4d6 for weapon damage, etc.)

- Currently, the user's rolls do not persist between sessions, so I need to fix that.
