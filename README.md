# Tabletop Dice Roller

This is Tabletop Dice Roller, a Flutter/Dart mobile app that rolls dice for board games, tabletop roleplaying games, and more! From a d2 coin, all the way up to a d100 percentage dice, and everything in between. The numbers are randomized many times, simulate a real and accurate dice roll. If you roll the same combo of dice often (4d6, 2d4, etc.), you can save dice profiles for easy later use. Just select your dice, then hit **_Roll!_** to let the dice decide your fate!

I created this app to have a fun, interesting, and convenient way to roll dice. It's especially made for when you do not have dice with you, for players new to tabletop / board games, and everyone else who wants a fun new way to roll dice!

## Future Work

- More pages: Add Dice and Add Modifiers

- Dice Profiles: the user can save "profiles" of their commonly rolled dice & modifiers so they can easily reroll them later. (2d20 for advantage/disadvantage, 4d6 + 5 for weapon damage, etc.)

- Memory: The user's roll history is cleared when the app closes, so I need to make that data persist across sessions. I also need to make the dice profiles persist.
